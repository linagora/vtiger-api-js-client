 * The {@link Transport} class is the base class for providers of a HTTP transport layer.<br />
 * A concrete implementation is required to implement {@link Transport#post} so that this method returns a
 * {@link Promise} that will be resolved or rejected depending on the result of the underlying HTTP request<br />
 * To create {@link Promise} instances, a {@link Transport} implementation should use a {@link PromiseProvider}.
 * {@link Client} instances will automatically provide transports with the configured {@link PromiseProvider} as the
 * `promiseProvider` property.
 * <br />
 * This level of abstraction allows users of the library to plug in their own implementation in order to use their
 * favorite HTTP transport library. Implementations for [Request]{@link https://github.com/request/request}
 * and [jQuery]{@link https://jquery.com/} are provided.
